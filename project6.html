        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I joined a company in sep. 2020. Due to the fact that prev. Designer was leaving, I continued his work of redesigning the homepage. Since there were already first visions and concepts, and the direction was set, my tasks included to incorporate
            new CI (which was provide by external branding agency) to new homepage concept and ensure consistency by reviewing the coded version of the UI Design. One of the main challenges was to ensure usability, design, and performance in different
            viewport sizes. By defining common breakpoints and focusing on content, allowed us to support our users across all devices. Another big challenge, what I was facing, was ensuring visual consistency across different pages. To reduce redundancy
            I suggested to create a Design System. As result, I researched and evaluated tools for maintaining of Design System, and estimated the strategy and approach for future design system.

            <h1>Product Detail Page</h1>
            <p>By studying the landscape of competitors and user flow analysis, was clear that the current PDP was lacking on discovery intuitive and engagement. The goal of redesigning of PDP was to showcase users relevant products, and nudges shoppers
                through their journey toward products and eliminate dead ends. For this purpose we removed unnecessary elements and build visual clarity and prioritized the important information on the page. As a result shoppers can increase their chances
                of spotting the perfect product and company can capture significantly more revenue.

            <p>
                The wish list feature was implemented to allow customers to create a list of items they arenâ€™t ready to purchase yet, but hope to either buy in the future. In this way, we can drive sales, engagement, and retention and we could lower cart abandonment
                rates, boost user experience.

            <p>
                Since fashion e-commerce is a visual experience, it's important to use the right e-commerce images to draw traffic. The online shop has a most common aspect ratio (1:1), while fashion industry requires portrait orientations. As a result I suggested to
                showcase products in a consistent aspect ratio 2:3.

            <p>
                Since we wanted to make users aware of existing offers and provide easy access for users, we redesigned the discount-related contentÂ  on our platform. It was displayed in â€žbuy sectionâ€œ for easy discover. By adding CTA â€žcopyâ€œ, we wanted to encourage users
                to use our coupons. Overall the coupon/promotions banners are communicated side-wide to boost usage of them. (In the hero space on the homepage, promotional callouts on the product listing page, Banners at the top of whole shop).

                We redesigned a size chart drop down, by showing customers how many products are left. This should help to drive more engagement and purchases, since humans place a higher value on an object that is scarce.

                We decided to remove quantity fields, which where next to add to cart button. Based on our research, users can be distracted by quantity fields, which may cause interaction issues. In addition, most items in the shop war bought in single quantities.

                In addition to optimize the PDP, was decided to display similar products and â€šperfect pairingsâ€™. Since shoppers might like that, what work well with the current product, or products, that others have purchased. This way we can help guide shoppers to the
                products that meet their needs, potentially encouraging them to continue shopping.

                cart, checkout for countries, where klarna wasnâ€™t supported, PLP filters, wishlist feature was integrated and many other small improvements, which have a bigger impact on user experience, like, integrating address validator, adding text
                masking, improvement touch target sizes on mobile and many others. Whoo, this is a really long post, thank you for reading till the end ðŸ˜Š
